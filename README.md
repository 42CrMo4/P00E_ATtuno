# KiCad ATtuno Dev board

The ATtuno is a dev board for ATtiny 1 series microcontroller, loosely based on the UNO form factor. 

## Description

The ATtuno is an excellent starting point for those looking to explore the ATtiny 1 series microcontroller platform. 
Inspired by the familiar Arduino Uno form factor, this board offers a user-friendly approach to working with ATtiny Series 1 MCUs.
Key features:

- Arduino Uno-inspired layout
- Generous board size for comfortable handling
- Robust Wago clamping pin headers for secure connections
- Designed for quick start and rapid prototyping
- 3.3V and 5V compatible

This dev board bridges the gap between the popular Arduino ecosystem and the powerful, efficient ATtiny Series 1 microcontrollers. 
Its thoughtful design allows both beginners and experienced makers to quickly dive into projects without the need for delicate handling or specialized tools.

### Goal

The goal of the project will be:
- [ ] **undefined** - not known what the project will bring 
- [ ] **learn** - personally learn something new, no usefull outcome expected
- [ ] **prototype** - a working prototype or mvp
- [x] **80-20-rule** - 80% outcome with 20% effort
- [ ] **Product** - lets see :wink:
